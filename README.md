# Heart-Diseases-Project
A comprehensive Heart Disease Analysis project using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and ML. Includes full EDA, risk-factor evaluation, correlation study, data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling to identify high-risk patients and support early diagnosis.
# Heart Disease Data Analysis & Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a clinical heart disease dataset to uncover health patterns, risk factors, and correlations using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools. It focuses on identifying high-risk patients, understanding medical attributes, and supporting early diagnosis.

## 🩺 Dataset Summary
The dataset contains patient medical details:
- Age, Gender
- Chest Pain Type
- Blood Pressure (RestingBP)
- Cholesterol Levels
- Maximum Heart Rate (MaxHR)
- ECG Results
- Exercise-Induced Angina
- Oldpeak (ST Depression)
- HeartDisease (Target: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Detect high-risk patients early.
- Reduce mortality through preventive diagnosis.
- Identify key clinical factors contributing to heart disease.
- Build data-driven insights for healthcare decision-making.
- Enable segmentation and predictive modeling.

## 🔍 EDA & Analysis Performed
- Summary statistics & data profiling  
- Visualizing distributions and correlations  
- Outlier detection (IQR method)  
- Gender-wise health metric comparison  
- Age-group segmentation  
- Risk pattern analysis  
- Cholesterol, BP, MaxHR variability  
- Heart disease rate comparison  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified high-risk patient groups  
- Found correlations between cholesterol, BP, age & heart disease  
- Chest pain types strongly influence risk  
- Patterns help guide preventive healthcare initiatives  

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Build machine learning prediction models  
- Deploy a clinical risk scoring dashboard  
- Automate patient report generation
